Looks like they built this site recently w/ a non-design focused marketing firm.</li>\n  <li>Using Wordpress</li>\n  <li>Site is responsive but it has a ton of issues and breaks down on mobile screen sizes</li>\n  <li>Clean and simple design approach</li>\n  <li>Phone # and Contact Us module appears on every page</li>\n  <li>Weather widget and Contact Us form appears on most of the internal pages</li>\n  <li>Minimal content</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Header</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Logo</li>\n  <li>Phone number</li>\n  <li>&#8216;Serving South Central MA since 1996&#8217;</li>\n  <li>Main navigation\n    <ul>\n      <li>Home</li>\n      <li>Producs &amp; Services</li>\n      <li>Contact Us / Request Quote</li>\n      <li>Photo Gallery</li>\n      <li>About Us</li>\n      <li>Article Library (basically a blog w/ categories)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Footer</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Minimal Footer, just has copyright information</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Homepage</h5>\n<p>The homepage of the site primarily focuses on a big image w/ parralax. The image offers no context at all, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense. Secondary focus is the Contact Us module and Services grid.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Banner Image</li>\n  <li>Contact Us module</li>\n  <li>Grid of 4 services w/ title, image and learn more</li>\n  <li>Intro text and link to a magazine article they where featured in</li>\n  <li>Little weather widget</li>\n  <li>Featured articles from their &#8216;article library&#8217;</li>\n  <li>Big contact us form</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Content Pages</h5>\n<p>Most of the content pages consist of a big header image along with content in a 2 or 3 column grid, with little short blubs of text. You can tell the tried to get as much content &#8216;above the fold&#8217; as possible.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Products/Services Page\n    <ul>\n      <li>List of services w/ heading and short text, with link to more detailed page. Content is pretty slim but they have images releating to the content which is good.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Contact Us Page &amp; Module\n    <ul>\n      <li>Address, Phone &amp; Fax information for the company</li>\n      <li>First, Last name</li>\n      <li>Email, Phone</li>\n      <li>Subject</li>\n      <li>How can we help you?</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Photo Gallery\n    <ul>\n      <li>Just a simple 1 page gallery with 30 or so photo&#8217;s that automatically flip thru</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>About Us\n    <ul>\n      <li>Couple paragraphs and a couple images</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Article Library\n    <ul>\n      <li>Basically a poor impelmentation of a blog</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5>Modules</h5>\n<ul>\n  <li>Instant Quote\n    <ul>\n      <li>It&#8217;s not really &#8216;instant&#8217;, it just let&#8217;s you know someone will contact you within 24 hours. Form is ajax based so it doesn&#8217;t refresh the page</li>\n      <li>Name</li>\n      <li>Address, City, State</li>\n      <li>Phone, Email</li>\n      <li>Authorization code which you have to type in</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Pro&#8217;s</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Content is laid out half-way decent, some good use of white space. The site isn&#8217;t too cluttered.</li>\n  <li>About us has photo&#8217;s of the workers, which gives it a personal touch</li>\n  <li>Contact Us module(s) on every page so you are 1 or 2 clicks away from the form interaction</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Con&#8217;s</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>Doesn&#8217;t make sense to have the Contact Us banner and the actual form module on the same page</li>\n  <li>Weather widget is really cheesy</li>\n  <li>Services images have text in them for each service</li>\n  <li>On all the pages they have this Visa/MC graphic which just looks thrown in.</li>\n  <li>Photo gallery is really tiny. People want to see good photo&#8217;s on what services you can provide, and this isn&#8217;t the way to do it!</li>\n  <li>About us page doesn&#8217;t really say much. </li>\n  <li>Article library is really a poor implementation of a &#8216;blog&#8217;. You have to click the category and then you see the posts, but it&#8217;s not something easy to find, it&#8217;s all text as well and doesn&#8217;t invite users in for reading.</li>\n</ul>\n",
